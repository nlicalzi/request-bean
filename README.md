Full authentication system allowing users to sign up, sign in, log out and delete their account.

## Bins

Bins are records in the database belonging to users. A unique endpoint is autogenerated when creating a bin. This endpoint is where requests can be sent to for parsing and viewing. This endpoint accepts any HTTP method.

![dashboard](./.github/images/dashboard.png)

The dashboard page allows users to view their created bins.

![create bin](./.github/images/create.png)

Users can create new bins to separate requests as needed.

## Requests

![payload](./.github/images/payload.png)

Requests can be sent to bins enabling users to inspect headers, body, query strings and cookies.

## Websockets

![websockets](./.github/images/websockets.gif)

Requests are streamed to the frontend via websockets. This allows users to send requests and view them without having to refresh the page.

## Webhooks

![create bin](./.github/images/create.png)

When creating a bin, users can optionally add a webhook url. When Request Bean recieves a request for this bin, the payload of the request will be forwarded to the provided URL.
